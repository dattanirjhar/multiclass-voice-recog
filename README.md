## Overview

This repository hosts a multiclass voice recognition project, enabling the classification of audio input into several distinct categories. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize different voice commands or speech patterns. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for applications such as voice-controlled systems, automated transcription services, and advanced audio analysis.

## Features

- **Multiclass Classification**: Accurately distinguishes between multiple voice commands or categories.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models for optimal recognition rates.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of voice samples and categories.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to specific use cases and datasets.
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for real-time voice recognition applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (recommended)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dattanirjhar/multiclass-voice-recog.git
    cd multiclass-voice-recog
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Data Preparation:**

    - Ensure your dataset is structured according to the guidelines in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
    - Place your audio files in the appropriate directories.

2.  **Model Training:**

    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```

    - Modify the `config.yaml` file to adjust training parameters as needed.

3.  **Inference/Prediction:**

    ```bash
    python predict.py --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav --model_path path/to/trained/model.pth
    ```

## Dataset

The project requires a structured dataset with audio samples organized into categories. Each category should have its own directory containing the corresponding audio files.
